        <h2> Unfinished Business: Vince why?</h2>
        <p>
            Why did the show only have 6 seasons?<br>
            It easily could have had 7 seasons minimum, or maybe at least an extra movie like
            <em>El Camino</em>, or at least extra content about what Saul was doing during
            <i> Breaking Bad</i>. But no, 6 seasons, no movie, no follow up. I am devastated.
            <strong>Bravo Vince!</strong>

He – he covered his tracks, he got that idiot at the copy shop to lie for him. You think this is something? You think this is bad? This? This chicanery? He's done worse. That billboard! Are you telling me that a man just happens to fall like that? No! He orchestrated it! Jimmy! He defecated through a sunroof! And I saved him! And I shouldn't have. I took him into my own firm! What was I thinking? He'll never change. He'll never change! Ever since he was 9, always the same! Couldn't keep his hands out of the cash drawer! But not our Jimmy! Couldn't be precious Jimmy! Stealing them blind! And he gets to be a lawyer!? What a sick joke! I should've stopped him when I had the chance! And you – you have to stop him! You-
